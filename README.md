How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

The best way to write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable is to follow the principles of clean code. Use menagingful names, keep functionality simple and dry. Handle errors, and test your code. Project one was much better at this, since I was more familure with the process. Project Two was terribly dificult since the template given was buggy to begin with and not named, encapsulated or testable. It was a large jumble of code and html that was dificult to parse let alone read. I think it would be better to embed the MongoDB.py calls in the Client side code next time I do a project like this sence the practical change that was made was renaming the find method read. It made trouble shooting harder when figuring out exactly how to write queries. I had to keep in mind I was passing the query to my code that passed it on to MongoDB, and that was not helpful.    


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I did a lot of looking for solutions online and read the documentation. I should have just asked why the code I was given was broken to start and that may have saved a lot of time. Next time when I encounter a problem I'll reach out for assistance much eairlyer on in the process because if the example given dosn't run, I'm not going to figure it out on my own. I'm not sure I was taught any strategies or techniques. We just learned about a few tools I'll likely not use again. 


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

For my job I produce machine learnign modles used in cyber threat detection. We provide value to stakeholders so they can more efficently, gather, organize, controll, and understand data. This can help users to make better decisions that save time, money, and resources, for a better world.
